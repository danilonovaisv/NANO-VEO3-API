# Image Upscaling

Upscale image resolution with AI-powered detail enhancement using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Upscale this image to the highest resolution possible. Preserve sharpness and fine detail. Enhance texture without adding artifacts."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/low-res-photo.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Upscale this image to the highest resolution possible. Preserve sharpness and fine detail. Enhance texture without adding artifacts."}],
    # Images are included in the message content array above
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Reference Image

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Upscale the first image. Use the second image as a quality reference for the level of detail and sharpness I expect in the output."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/low-res.jpg"}},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/quality-reference.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time SSE responses, or `"stream": false` for complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

## Available Models

| Model | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **topaz-upscale-image** | Industry-leading upscaling, detail recovery, artifact removal | All upscaling tasks, print prep, photo restoration |

> each::sense automatically selects topaz-upscale-image when upscaling requests are detected.

## What AI Upscaling Can Do

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Resolution increase** | Scale images 2x, 4x, or more while adding realistic detail |
| **Detail recovery** | Reconstruct textures, edges, and fine features from low-res sources |
| **Noise reduction** | Remove compression artifacts, JPEG blocking, and noise |
| **Sharpening** | Enhance edge clarity without halos or over-sharpening |
| **Face enhancement** | Recover facial detail from small or blurry face regions |
| **Texture synthesis** | Generate plausible texture detail that was not in the original |

## Upscaling Scenarios

| Scenario | Input Quality | What to Expect |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Thumbnail to full-size** | 100-300px | Good overall shape; fine detail is synthesized |
| **Web image to print** | 600-1200px | Excellent; most detail preserved and enhanced |
| **Social media to poster** | 1080-2000px | Outstanding; print-ready quality |
| **Old photo restoration** | Variable, often degraded | Good recovery; combine with denoising |
| **AI-generated image** | 512-1024px typical | Excellent; AI upscaling works very well on AI images |
| **Screenshot to high-res** | Variable | Good for photos in screenshots; text may blur |

## Prompt Tips

### Basic Upscaling

```
"Upscale this image. Maximize resolution while keeping it sharp and natural."
```

### With Quality Direction

```
"Upscale this image 4x. Prioritize sharpness over smoothness.
Recover fabric texture detail and skin pore detail.
Do not over-smooth or make it look plasticky."
```

### Specific Use Case

```
"Upscale this product photo for a 24x36 inch print at 300 DPI.
Ensure edges remain crisp and colors stay accurate.
Remove any compression artifacts from the original."
```

### Combining Upscale with Enhancement

```
"Upscale this old family photo. Remove noise and grain.
Sharpen facial features. Correct any color fading.
Output at the highest resolution possible."
```

## Resolution and Print Size Guide

| Input Resolution | Upscale Factor | Output Resolution | Max Print Size (300 DPI) |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 512 x 512 | 4x | 2048 x 2048 | ~7 x 7 inches |
| 1024 x 1024 | 4x | 4096 x 4096 | ~14 x 14 inches |
| 1920 x 1080 | 4x | 7680 x 4320 | ~26 x 14 inches |
| 2048 x 1536 | 2x | 4096 x 3072 | ~14 x 10 inches |
| 3000 x 2000 | 2x | 6000 x 4000 | ~20 x 13 inches |

## Common Pitfalls

- **Extremely low resolution** (under 100px) has very little data to work with. Results will be soft regardless.
- **Over-upscaling** (e.g., 16x) produces diminishing returns. 2x-4x is the sweet spot for quality.
- **Expecting new information**: Upscaling enhances and synthesizes detail, but cannot recover information that was never captured.
- **Text in images** may become blurry or distorted during upscaling. Text is harder to reconstruct than natural imagery.
- **Heavy JPEG compression** in the source adds artifacts that upscaling may amplify. Ask for artifact removal explicitly.
- **Over-smoothing** can make images look artificial. Specify "preserve texture, avoid plastic look" if faces appear too smooth.

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Start with the best source** you have (highest resolution, least compressed)
2. **Upscale first**, then apply other edits
3. **Specify the end use** (web, print, social) so the model optimizes accordingly
4. **Combine with editing** for complete enhancement: upscale, then color correct, then final adjustments
