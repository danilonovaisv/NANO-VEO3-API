# AI Product Photo

Generate professional product photography for e-commerce and marketing using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Professional product photo of a matte black ceramic coffee mug on a pure white background. Studio lighting with soft shadow underneath, sharp focus, center frame, commercial product photography, clean and minimal, suitable for e-commerce listing"
      }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Professional product photo of a matte black ceramic coffee mug on a pure white background. Studio lighting with soft shadow underneath, sharp focus, center frame, commercial product photography, clean and minimal, suitable for e-commerce listing"
    }]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Reference Image

Provide your actual product photo to generate improved or alternative shots:

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Take this product and create a professional studio product photo. Place it on a clean white background with perfect studio lighting, soft shadows, and sharp focus. E-commerce ready, high resolution quality."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/my-product.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time SSE responses, or `"stream": false` for complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

  "three-quarter angle on white background showing the cap detail and bottle curve, studio lighting, secondary listing image"
  "close-up detail shot of the bamboo cap texture and logo area, shallow depth of field, macro product photography"
  "the bottle on a gym bench next to a towel and dumbbells, lifestyle context, natural indoor lighting"
  "overhead flat lay: the bottle with its packaging box, user manual card, and cleaning brush laid out neatly, unboxing arrangement"
)

for SHOT in "${SHOTS[@]}"; do

    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
    -d "{

## Amazon Image Requirements Checklist

- Main image: pure white background (RGB 255,255,255)
- Product fills 85% or more of the image frame
- No text, logos, watermarks, or borders
- No accessories not included in purchase
- Sharp, well-lit, realistic color representation

## Common Pitfalls

- **Text and logos on products** render poorly. Describe shape, color, and position of labels but do not rely on specific words appearing correctly.
- **Reflective products** (glass, chrome, jewelry) need careful lighting descriptions to avoid blown highlights.
- **White product on white background** — add "subtle shadow" or "slight gradient" so the product does not disappear.
- **Multiple products** of different sizes in one shot — specify relative positioning and scale.
- **Color accuracy** — describe exact colors (e.g., "Pantone coral 16-1546" or "hex #2C3E50") when precision matters.
