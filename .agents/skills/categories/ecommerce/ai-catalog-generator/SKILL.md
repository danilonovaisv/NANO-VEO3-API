# AI Catalog Generator

Generate consistent e-commerce catalog imagery across entire product lines using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "E-commerce catalog photo: a navy blue backpack with tan leather straps and brass buckles, front view on a pure white background, product centered filling 85% of the frame, soft studio lighting with minimal shadow, sharp focus, consistent e-commerce catalog style, product photography"
      }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "E-commerce catalog photo: a navy blue backpack with tan leather straps and brass buckles, front view on a pure white background, product centered filling 85% of the frame, soft studio lighting with minimal shadow, sharp focus, consistent e-commerce catalog style, product photography"
    }]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Reference Image

Provide a product photo to generate additional catalog angles:

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Generate an e-commerce catalog photo of this product from a different angle. Show a three-quarter view from the left side. Match the same white background, lighting style, and product framing as a professional e-commerce catalog. Consistent with standard catalog photography."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/product-front.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time SSE responses, or `"stream": false` for complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

## Catalog Image Types

| Type | Purpose | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Main / Hero** | primary listing image | front view, white background, product fills frame |
| **Alternate Angle** | secondary views | side, back, three-quarter, top-down |
| **Detail / Close-Up** | feature highlights | zoom on texture, hardware, stitching |
| **Color Variants** | show available colors | same angle, different product colors |
| **Scale / Size** | size communication | product next to a common reference object |
| **Group / Collection** | category overview | multiple products arranged together |
| **Lifestyle Context** | emotional connection | product in use or styled setting |

## Consistency Framework

For a professional catalog, every image must share:

| Element | Keep Consistent |
|---------|----------------|
| **Background** | same color and gradient (or pure white) |
| **Lighting** | same setup: direction, intensity, softness |
| **Camera Angle** | same default angle across products |
| **Framing** | same product-to-frame ratio (e.g., 85%) |
| **Shadow** | same shadow type: drop, contact, or none |
| **Color Grading** | same warmth, saturation, contrast |

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### Template Prompt (Reuse for Consistency)

Create a base prompt and swap only the product description:

```
"E-commerce catalog photo: [PRODUCT DESCRIPTION], [ANGLE] on a pure white background, product centered filling 85% of the frame, soft studio lighting with minimal contact shadow, sharp focus throughout, consistent e-commerce catalog photography style."
```

### Angle Specifications

```
front view — straight-on from the front
back view — straight-on from the back
left side profile — 90 degrees left
right three-quarter — 45 degrees from right
top-down — directly overhead
low angle — slightly below eye level looking up
```

## Catalog Planning Checklist

For each product in your catalog, generate:

1. **Main image** — front view, white background (required for all platforms)
2. **Alternate angle** — three-quarter or side view (shows depth/shape)
3. **Detail close-up** — material, craftsmanship, or key feature
4. **Scale reference** — optional, product next to common object
5. **Lifestyle shot** — product in use or styled context
6. **Color variants** — one shot per available color (same angle)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Inconsistent lighting** across products — use the exact same lighting description in every prompt.
- **Product size varies** across images — always specify "product fills 85% of the frame" (or your target ratio).
- **Background color shifts** — "white background" can vary slightly. Specify "pure white (RGB 255,255,255)" for strict consistency.
- **Text and brand names** on labels will render incorrectly. Plan to composite labels in post or accept generic placeholder designs.
- **Too many products in one grid** — more than 4-6 items per composite image reduces quality per product.
- **Mixed angles** across a product line — use the same default angle for all main images.
