# AI Video Editor

Edit and transform videos with natural language instructions using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Edit this video: apply a warm cinematic color grade with slightly desaturated tones, add a subtle film grain overlay, and enhance the contrast for a moody atmospheric look"},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/raw-footage.mp4"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Edit this video: apply a warm cinematic color grade with slightly desaturated tones, add a subtle film grain overlay, and enhance the contrast for a moody atmospheric look"
    }],
    # Images are included in the message content array above
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) responses, or `"stream": false` to receive the complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

## Edit Types

| Edit Type | Description | Example Prompt |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Color Grading** | Adjust colors, tones, and mood | "Apply a teal and orange cinematic look" |
| **Style Transfer** | Convert visual style of footage | "Make this look like a Studio Ghibli anime" |
| **Weather Effects** | Add environmental effects | "Add falling snow and a winter atmosphere" |
| **Time of Day** | Change lighting conditions | "Transform this daytime scene to golden hour" |
| **Visual Effects** | Add particles, glow, or overlays | "Add floating fireflies and a magical glow" |
| **Enhancement** | Improve quality and detail | "Stabilize, sharpen, and reduce noise" |

## Examples

### Cinematic Color Grade

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Apply a cinematic teal-and-orange color grade to this video. Shadows pushed toward teal, highlights toward warm amber. Slightly raised black levels for a filmic look. Consistent throughout the clip."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/interview-footage.mp4"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Style Transfer

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Transform this real-world video into a hand-painted watercolor animation style. Soft brush strokes, gentle color bleeding at edges, paper texture visible, maintain smooth motion. Keep the same subjects and movements."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/park-walk.mp4"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Add Environmental Effects

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Add rain to this outdoor video: heavy raindrops falling, wet reflections on the ground, slight mist in the distance, darker sky. The rain should interact naturally with the scene and be consistent frame-to-frame."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/street-scene.mp4"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

## Prompt Tips

- **Be specific about the look**: "teal and orange" is better than "cinematic colors"
- **Mention consistency**: "Apply uniformly across all frames" prevents flickering
- **Describe the reference**: "Like a Christopher Nolan film" communicates a clear aesthetic
- **One major edit per pass**: Combining too many edits may produce inconsistent results
- **Specify what to preserve**: "Keep the original motion and composition" prevents unwanted changes

## Common Color Grade Presets

| Look | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Teal & Orange** | Cool shadows, warm highlights — blockbuster cinema |
| **Desaturated Cool** | Muted, blue-gray tones — thriller, drama |
| **Warm Vintage** | Golden haze, lifted blacks — nostalgic, indie film |
| **High Contrast B&W** | Dramatic black and white — documentary, noir |
| **Pastel Soft** | Low contrast, soft colors — romance, dream sequence |
| **Neon Cyberpunk** | Saturated pinks, blues, greens — sci-fi, music videos |
