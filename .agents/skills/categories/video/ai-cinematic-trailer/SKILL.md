# AI Cinematic Trailer

Create dramatic cinematic trailers and teaser sequences using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Generate a video: cinematic trailer shot — a lone warrior stands on a cliff edge overlooking a burning medieval city, cape billowing in hot wind, ash falling like snow, camera slowly dollying backward to reveal the massive scale of destruction, dramatic orchestral mood, desaturated warm tones, anamorphic widescreen"
      }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Generate a video: cinematic trailer shot — a lone warrior stands on a cliff edge overlooking a burning medieval city, cape billowing in hot wind, ash falling like snow, camera slowly dollying backward to reveal the massive scale of destruction, dramatic orchestral mood, desaturated warm tones, anamorphic widescreen"
    }]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Concept Art Reference

Use concept art or storyboard frames as visual guides:

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Create a cinematic trailer shot based on this concept art. Bring the scene to life with dramatic camera movement, atmospheric effects like fog and particles, cinematic color grading, anamorphic lens flares, slow deliberate motion"},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/concept-art.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) responses, or `"stream": false` to receive the complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate a video: black screen slowly fading in to reveal a desolate desert wasteland stretching to the horizon, wind blowing sand, extreme wide shot, post-apocalyptic, silence, slow camera rise, muted orange and gray tones"}],
