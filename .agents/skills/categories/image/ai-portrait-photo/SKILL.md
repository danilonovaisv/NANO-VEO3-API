# AI Portrait Photo

Generate studio-quality portrait photography using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Studio portrait of an elderly man with deep wrinkles and kind eyes, wearing a wool fisherman sweater, Rembrandt lighting, shallow depth of field, 85mm f/1.4 lens, medium format film grain, intimate close-up"
      }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Studio portrait of an elderly man with deep wrinkles and kind eyes, wearing a wool fisherman sweater, Rembrandt lighting, shallow depth of field, 85mm f/1.4 lens, medium format film grain, intimate close-up"
    }]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Reference Image

Use a reference photo for style matching or subject likeness:

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Create a studio portrait of this person in the style of Annie Leibovitz. Dramatic side lighting, rich tones, dark background, contemplative expression, editorial quality"},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/reference-person.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) responses, or `"stream": false` to receive the complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

## Lighting Setups

| Setup | Description | Mood |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Rembrandt** | 45-degree key light, triangle shadow on cheek | Dramatic, classic |
| **Butterfly** | Light directly above and in front | Glamorous, beauty |
| **Split** | Light from one side, half-face shadow | Moody, mysterious |
| **Broad** | Key light on the side closest to camera | Flattering, fills face |
| **Loop** | Small shadow of nose on cheek | Natural, versatile |
| **Rim/Edge** | Backlight outlining the subject | Dramatic, separation |
| **Natural Window** | Soft diffused side light | Intimate, warm |

## Lens and Camera Keywords

```
85mm f/1.4 — classic portrait lens, beautiful bokeh
135mm f/2 — compressed background, flattering proportions
50mm f/1.2 — natural field of view, cinematic
medium format — larger sensor look, shallow DOF
Hasselblad — medium format film quality
Kodak Portra 400 — warm skin tones, film look
Fuji Pro 400H — cooler tones, pastel film look
```

## Examples

### Editorial Fashion Portrait

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "High fashion editorial portrait of a model with slicked-back hair, wearing an oversized black blazer with nothing underneath, strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, dramatic side lighting, desaturated tones, Vogue editorial style, 135mm lens"
      }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Environmental Portrait

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Environmental portrait of a female ceramicist in her workshop, clay-dusted apron, natural light from a large window, pottery wheel and shelves of work visible in soft background, warm earthy tones, 50mm f/1.8, documentary style"
      }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Fine Art Portrait

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Fine art portrait inspired by Dutch Golden Age paintings. A woman in a deep blue velvet dress, pearl earring, chiaroscuro lighting, oil painting texture, rich dark background, three-quarter view, classical composition"
      }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

## Prompt Structure

```
[portrait type] of [subject description], [attire/styling], [lighting setup],
[background], [lens/camera], [mood/tone], [composition]
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Skipping lighting details** — lighting defines the mood of a portrait more than anything else
- **Too many accessories** — keep styling simple; one statement piece works better
- **Ignoring background** — a busy background competes with the subject
- **Not specifying framing** — "close-up," "half-body," or "three-quarter" changes the feel dramatically
