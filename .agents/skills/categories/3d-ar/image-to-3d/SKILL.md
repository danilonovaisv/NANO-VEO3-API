# Image to 3D

Convert photos and images into 3D object renders using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Convert this image into a 3D model. Generate a three-quarter view 3D render showing the object from a slightly elevated angle, revealing depth and volume. Clean studio background, soft lighting, photorealistic 3D rendering."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/product-photo.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Convert this image into a 3D model. Generate a three-quarter view 3D render showing the object from a slightly elevated angle, revealing depth and volume. Clean studio background, soft lighting, photorealistic 3D rendering."
    }],
    # Images are included in the message content array above
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Multiple Reference Images

Provide multiple angles for more accurate reconstruction:

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Convert this object into a 3D model using these reference angles. The first image shows the front, the second shows the side. Generate a clean 3D render from a new angle (three-quarter view from above) that combines both perspectives. Studio lighting, neutral background."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/front-view.jpg"}},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/side-view.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time SSE responses, or `"stream": false` for complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

## Use Cases

| Use Case | Input | Output |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Product 3D Preview** | product photo | 3D render from new angles |
| **Concept Art to 3D** | 2D character/object art | 3D visualization |
| **Real Object Digitization** | phone photo | 3D model render |
| **Multi-View Generation** | single photo | multiple angle renders |
| **E-commerce 360** | product image | rotated 3D views |
| **Game Asset Reference** | sketch or photo | 3D model for reference |

## Batch Workflow: 360-Degree Views

```bash
OBJECT_IMAGE="https://example.com/product.jpg"

ANGLES=(
  "front view, straight-on"
  "right side profile"
  "three-quarter view from the right, slightly elevated"
  "rear view"
  "three-quarter view from the left, slightly elevated"
  "left side profile"
)

for ANGLE in "${ANGLES[@]}"; do
  curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
    -d "{
      \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Convert this object into a 3D model render. Show it from $ANGLE. Maintain original colors and materials. Clean white background, studio lighting, photorealistic 3D render.\"}],
      \"image_urls\": [\"$OBJECT_IMAGE\"],
      \"stream\": false
    }"
  echo "---"
done
```

## Best Practices for Input Images

- **Clean background** — white or solid color backgrounds produce better results than cluttered scenes.
- **Good lighting** — evenly lit photos reveal more surface detail for reconstruction.
- **Single object** — isolate the subject. Multiple objects confuse the reconstruction.
- **Sharp focus** — blurry or low-resolution images lose detail in 3D conversion.
- **No heavy occlusion** — the more of the object visible, the better the 3D inference.

## Common Pitfalls

- **AI generates rendered images**, not actual 3D mesh files. The output is a new-angle 2D render of the interpreted 3D form.
- **Occluded parts are inferred** — the back of an object seen only from the front is guessed. It may not match reality.
- **Flat or thin objects** (cards, stickers, flat art) do not convert meaningfully to 3D.
- **Reflective and transparent objects** (glass, mirrors) are harder to interpret correctly.
- **Scale is relative** — without reference objects, the model cannot infer absolute size.
