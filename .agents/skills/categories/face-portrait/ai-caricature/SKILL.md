# AI Caricature

Transform face photos into caricatures and cartoon portraits using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Create a fun caricature of this person. Exaggerate their most prominent features in a friendly, humorous way. Colorful cartoon style with a white background."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/headshot.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Create a fun caricature of this person. Exaggerate their most prominent features in a friendly, humorous way. Colorful cartoon style with a white background."
    }],
    # Images are included in the message content array above
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Reference Image

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Turn this person into a caricature cartoon with exaggerated features, comic book style, vibrant colors"},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/photo.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time SSE responses, or `"stream": false` for complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

## Caricature Styles

| Style | Description | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Classic Caricature** | Exaggerated features, hand-drawn look | Gifts, events, prints |
| **Comic Book** | Bold lines, halftone dots, superhero feel | Avatars, fun profiles |
| **Manga/Anime** | Big eyes, anime proportions, stylized hair | Social media, gaming |
| **Disney/Pixar** | 3D-rendered look, friendly, family-oriented | Profile pics, gifts |
| **Bobblehead** | Oversized head on tiny body | Humorous gifts, desk art |
| **Editorial** | Witty, political-cartoon style | Articles, commentary |
| **Chibi** | Ultra-cute, tiny body, huge head | Stickers, emotes |
| **Pop Art** | Bold colors, Warhol/Lichtenstein inspired | Wall art, merchandise |

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### Specify the Style Clearly

Different caricature styles produce very different results. Always name the style:

```
Create a [style] caricature of this person. [Feature emphasis]. [Color/background]. [Additional context].
```

### Feature Exaggeration

You can guide which features to exaggerate:

```
Exaggerate the big smile and dimples.
Emphasize the strong jawline and bushy eyebrows.
Make the eyes extra large and expressive.
```

### Context and Props

Adding context makes caricatures more fun:

```
Show them holding a laptop, wearing a chef hat, riding a skateboard,
playing guitar, in a superhero costume, sitting at a desk
```
