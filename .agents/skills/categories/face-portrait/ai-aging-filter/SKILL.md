# AI Aging Filter

Apply realistic age progression and regression effects to face photos using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Age the person in this photo to look about 75 years old. Add realistic wrinkles, age spots, gray hair, and slight sagging while keeping their identity clearly recognizable."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/young-portrait.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Age the person in this photo to look about 75 years old. Add realistic wrinkles, age spots, gray hair, and slight sagging while keeping their identity clearly recognizable."
    }],
    # Images are included in the message content array above
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Reference Image

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Make this person look 30 years older with natural aging effects, keeping their identity intact"},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/portrait.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time SSE responses, or `"stream": false` for complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

## Age Transformation Guide

| Target Age | Key Visual Changes |
|---|---|
| **Child (5-10)** | Rounder face, bigger eyes relative to face, smoother skin, softer features |
| **Teen (13-17)** | Slimmer face, more defined jaw, smooth skin, youthful proportions |
| **Young Adult (25-30)** | Defined features, no wrinkles, full hair color, firm skin |
| **Middle-Aged (45-55)** | Crow's feet, nasolabial folds, slight gray, some skin laxity |
| **Senior (65-75)** | Deep wrinkles, gray/white hair, age spots, thinning skin |
| **Elderly (80+)** | Pronounced wrinkles, very thin skin, white hair, sunken features |

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### Specify Target Age

Be precise about the desired age rather than vague. "Make them look 70" is better than "make them look old."

```
Age the person in this photo to approximately [age]. [Specific changes]. Keep their identity recognizable.
```

### Aging Characteristics to Mention

```
wrinkles, crow's feet, forehead lines, nasolabial folds,
gray hair, white hair, thinning hair, receding hairline,
age spots, sun spots, sagging skin, jowls, under-eye bags
```

### De-aging Characteristics

```
smooth skin, fuller cheeks, no wrinkles, darker hair color,
tighter jawline, even skin tone, brighter eyes, youthful glow
```

## Examples

### Age Progression to Senior

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Transform this person to look about 80 years old. Add deep wrinkles across the forehead and around the eyes, white thinning hair, age spots on the temples, and slight jowls. The skin should look thinner and more translucent. Maintain their identity and expression."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/adult-portrait.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### De-aging to Young Adult

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \

        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Make this person look 25 years old. Remove wrinkles, restore the hair to a natural dark color, tighten the jawline, smooth the skin, and brighten the eyes. Keep the same person recognizable but significantly younger."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/older-person.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Middle-Age Transformation

        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Age this 20-something person to look about 50. Add subtle crow's feet, light forehead lines, salt-and-pepper hair at the temples, and very slight nasolabial folds. Keep it realistic and natural, not dramatic."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/young-adult.jpg"}}
            ]
          }

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \

              {"type": "text", "text": "Transform this adult to look like a child around age 8. Round the face, make the eyes proportionally larger, remove all wrinkles and lines, add a childlike softness to the features. Keep enough resemblance to recognize this is the same person as a child."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/adult-face.jpg"}}
            ]

## Workflow: Age Timeline Series

```bash
# Step 1: De-age to childhood
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
