# AI Makeup Try-On

Apply virtual makeup to face photos with realistic results using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Apply a natural everyday makeup look to this photo. Light foundation evening out skin tone, subtle peach blush on the cheeks, brown eyeshadow with soft blending, thin black eyeliner, natural brown mascara, and a nude pink lipstick. Keep it realistic and wearable."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/bare-face.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Apply a natural everyday makeup look to this photo. Light foundation evening out skin tone, subtle peach blush on the cheeks, brown eyeshadow with soft blending, thin black eyeliner, natural brown mascara, and a nude pink lipstick. Keep it realistic and wearable."
    }],
    # Images are included in the message content array above
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Reference Image

You can use a second image as a makeup style reference:

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Apply the makeup style from the second image onto the face in the first image. Match the lipstick color, eyeshadow, and overall look."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/my-face.jpg"}},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/makeup-reference.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time SSE responses, or `"stream": false` for complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### Be Specific About Each Area

Describe makeup for each facial area separately for best results:

```
Apply makeup to this photo:
- Base: [foundation type and coverage]
- Eyes: [eyeshadow colors, liner style, lash look]
- Cheeks: [blush color and placement, contour]
- Lips: [color, finish, style]
```

### Color Precision

Use specific color names rather than generic ones:

```
Good: "dusty rose lipstick," "champagne gold eyeshadow," "terracotta blush"
Vague: "pink lipstick," "light eyeshadow," "some blush"
```

### Finish Types

Specify the finish for a more accurate result:

```
Matte, satin, glossy, dewy, shimmer, metallic, glitter, velvet
```
