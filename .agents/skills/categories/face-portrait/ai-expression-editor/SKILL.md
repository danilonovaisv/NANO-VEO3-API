# AI Expression Editor

Change facial expressions in photos naturally using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Change the expression in this photo to a warm, natural smile with slightly squinted eyes. Keep everything else exactly the same — same lighting, background, hair, and clothing."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/neutral-portrait.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Change the expression in this photo to a warm, natural smile with slightly squinted eyes. Keep everything else exactly the same — same lighting, background, hair, and clothing."
    }],
    # Images are included in the message content array above
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Reference Image

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Make this person look surprised with raised eyebrows and open mouth. Keep the rest of the photo unchanged."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/photo.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time SSE responses, or `"stream": false` for complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

## Expression Reference

| Expression | Key Facial Changes | Muscle Groups Involved |
|---|---|---|
| **Happy/Smile** | Upturned mouth corners, crow's feet, raised cheeks | Zygomatic major, orbicularis oculi |
| **Surprise** | Raised eyebrows, wide eyes, open mouth | Frontalis, levator palpebrae |
| **Sadness** | Downturned mouth, furrowed inner brows, droopy eyes | Depressor anguli oris, corrugator |
| **Anger** | Lowered brows, tense jaw, narrowed eyes | Corrugator, masseter |
| **Disgust** | Wrinkled nose, raised upper lip, squinted eyes | Levator labii, nasalis |
| **Fear** | Wide eyes, raised brows, tense mouth | Frontalis, platysma |
| **Contempt** | One-sided smirk, raised chin | Unilateral zygomatic |
| **Wink** | One eye closed, slight smile | Orbicularis oculi (unilateral) |

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### Be Precise About the Expression

Describe the expression in physical terms, not just the emotion name:

```
Change the expression to [emotion]: [specific facial changes]. Keep [everything to preserve].
```

### Intensity Levels

Control how strong the expression is:

- **Subtle**: "a slight smile," "barely noticeable frown"
- **Moderate**: "a clear smile," "visibly surprised"
- **Exaggerated**: "a wide beaming grin," "jaw-dropped shock"

### Preservation is Key

Always explicitly state what should not change:

```
Keep the same person identity, lighting, background, clothing, hair, and photo quality.
Only change the facial expression.
```

## Examples

### Neutral to Laughing

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Change this person from their neutral expression to genuinely laughing. Open mouth showing teeth, crinkled eyes, raised cheeks, natural laugh lines. The laugh should look authentic, not posed. Keep everything else in the photo identical."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/serious-face.jpg"}}
            ]
