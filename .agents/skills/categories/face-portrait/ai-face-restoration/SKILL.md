# AI Face Restoration

Restore damaged, blurry, or low-quality face photos to sharp, clear portraits using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Restore this old damaged family photo. Fix the scratches, remove the fading and yellowing, sharpen the faces, and enhance the overall quality to look like a modern photograph while preserving the original composition."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/old-damaged-photo.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Restore this old damaged family photo. Fix the scratches, remove the fading and yellowing, sharpen the faces, and enhance the overall quality to look like a modern photograph while preserving the original composition."
    }],
    # Images are included in the message content array above
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Reference Image

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Restore and enhance this blurry low-resolution face photo. Sharpen all facial details, improve clarity, and upscale to high quality"},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/blurry-face.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time SSE responses, or `"stream": false` for complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

## Restoration Capabilities

| Issue | What AI Can Fix | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
| **Blur/Out of Focus** | Sharpens features, recovers detail | Easy |
| **Low Resolution** | Upscales and adds realistic detail | Easy |
| **Scratches/Tears** | Removes physical damage artifacts | Medium |
| **Fading/Yellowing** | Restores original tones and contrast | Easy |
| **Water Damage** | Reconstructs warped or stained areas | Medium |
| **Missing Sections** | Intelligently fills in gaps | Hard |
| **Noise/Grain** | Reduces excessive film grain | Easy |
| **Color Loss** | Re-colorizes faded or B&W photos | Medium |

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### Describe the Damage

Be specific about what needs fixing so the AI can prioritize:

```
Restore this photo: [describe damage]. Fix [specific issues]. Enhance [quality aspects]. Preserve [what to keep unchanged].
```

### Preservation Keywords

Always mention what to preserve:

```
Keep the original composition, maintain the person's identity,
preserve the original expression, don't change the background,
keep the vintage clothing accurate
```

### Quality Enhancement Keywords

```
sharpen facial details, enhance resolution, improve clarity,
restore true-to-life colors, recover fine details, upscale
```

## Examples

      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Restore this 1960s family photograph. It has multiple scratches across the surface, yellowed with age, and the faces have lost detail. Remove all scratches, correct the yellowing to natural colors, sharpen the faces so individual features are clear, and enhance the overall resolution. Keep the vintage clothing and setting accurate."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/1960s-family.jpg"}}

              {"type": "text", "text": "Upscale and enhance this restored photo. Sharpen all faces, improve resolution, correct the faded colors to look vibrant and natural, and enhance overall clarity. Preserve the original composition exactly."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/cleaned-photo.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
