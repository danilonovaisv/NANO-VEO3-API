# LinkedIn Content

Create professional LinkedIn content graphics using [each::sense](https://docs.eachlabs.ai/sense/overview) — the intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the best model for your request.

## Quick Start

> Requires an each::labs API key. Get one at [eachlabs.ai](https://eachlabs.ai).

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Create a LinkedIn post image for a thought leadership article about the future of remote work. Clean white to light gray gradient background, abstract illustration of connected nodes representing a distributed team, teal and navy blue professional palette, polished corporate style, 1200x627 proportions."
      }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Using Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="eachsense/beta",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Create a LinkedIn post image for a thought leadership article about the future of remote work. Clean white to light gray gradient background, abstract illustration of connected nodes representing a distributed team, teal and navy blue professional palette, polished corporate style, 1200x627 proportions."
    }]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### With Reference Image

Match company brand guidelines or existing LinkedIn content:

```bash
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "Create a LinkedIn post image that matches this company brand style. Same professional color palette and visual elements, but for a hiring announcement. Include abstract people silhouettes and upward growth elements, 1200x627 proportions."},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/company-brand.jpg"}}
            ]
          }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

> Images are sent inside messages using the OpenAI multimodal content format. Maximum 4 images per request.

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` for real-time SSE responses, or `"stream": false` for complete result in a single response. Streaming is useful for showing progress in UIs; non-streaming is simpler for scripts and automation.

## LinkedIn Content Best Practices

- **Professional tone** — LinkedIn users expect polished, business-appropriate visuals
- **Blue dominates** — blues convey trust and professionalism; it is the most successful color family on LinkedIn
- **Light backgrounds** perform better in LinkedIn's white feed than dark backgrounds
- **Single image posts** get 2x more engagement than text-only posts
- **Carousel documents** (uploaded as PDFs) get the highest engagement rate of all formats
- **Consistency builds authority** — post with the same visual template regularly

## LinkedIn Carousel Strategy

Generate a cohesive set of carousel slides:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_EACHLABS_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1"
)

slides = [
    "Title slide: bold topic statement area, abstract ascending arrows, navy background",
    "Content slide: clean layout with icon placeholder on left, text area on right, white background with navy accent",
    "Statistics slide: large number display area with subtle chart illustration, light gray background",
    "Summary slide: key takeaways layout with checkmark icons, gradient navy to teal",
    "CTA slide: follow/connect prompt area, matching navy background with subtle pattern"
]

for i, slide_desc in enumerate(slides, 1):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="eachsense/beta",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"LinkedIn carousel slide {i}/5 about leadership principles. {slide_desc}. Professional corporate style, 1080x1080 square format."
        }]
    )
    print(f"Slide {i}: {response.choices[0].message.content}")
```

## Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Generate the post image
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "LinkedIn post image for a quarterly business review summary. Clean professional layout, abstract ascending bar chart visualization in navy and teal on white background, corporate and data-driven, 1200x627."
      }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'

# Step 2: Create a variation for an article cover
curl -X POST https://eachsense-agent.core.eachlabs.run/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $EACHLABS_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "LinkedIn post image for a quarterly business review summary. Clean professional layout, abstract ascending bar chart visualization in navy and teal on white background, corporate and data-driven, 1200x627."
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "..."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Adapt this to a LinkedIn article cover image. Same visual concept but slightly taller at 1200x644, add more context with subtle data dashboard elements in the background, keep the clean corporate style."
      }
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```
